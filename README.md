This repository contains a Stock Market Simulator mini-project developed as part of the ECS414U Object-Oriented Programming laboratory work. The project is implemented in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface.

The simulator provides a simplified stock trading environment where users can buy and sell stocks, track portfolio value, and simulate stock price changes over time. This project aims to reinforce concepts of object-oriented programming, including classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, in a practical, hands-on manner.
